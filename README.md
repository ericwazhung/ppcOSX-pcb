# ppcOSX-pcb

This is a fully-compiled and (hopefully) fully-self-contained version of gEDA-pcb
for Mac OSX 10.5.8 PPC

http://pcb.geda-project.org/

This *should* contain all the necessary libraries, but no promises.

This was *definitely* a hack-job by someone who *barely* knew what he was doing (me).
Further, that system (my only PPC) bit the dust over a year ago, 
and this was recovered from a backup.

But, last I checked it worked, and I used it to design several boards.

I think all's you'll have to do is click the "Download Zip" and extract it to a new folder 
(might have to name it pcb.app) then move that to your Applications folder.

This was put-together from macports... and a lot of effort on my part trying to figure out how to package it.


Let me know if you find this useful, or have any thoughts/experiences to add here!
